# everything in Python3 is an object
# Objects in Python may be mutable or immutable
# mutable objects can change value, immutable objects cannot

# Most fundamental types in Python are immutable:
    # numbers, strings, tuples
# Mutable objects include:
    # lists, dictionaries, other objects depending upon implementation
